"""


Given string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string.

The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string str if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B. For example, A = "xax" and B = "xax" then the index of first "x" must be different in the original string for A and B.

Example 1:

Input:
str = "axxzxy"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The given array with indexes looks like
a x x z x y 
0 1 2 3 4 5

The longest subsequence is "xx". 
It appears twice as explained below.

subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of str 


subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 4  <-- index of str 

We are able to use character 'x' 
(at index 2 in str) in both subsequences
as it appears on index 1 in subsequence A 
and index 0 in subsequence B.
